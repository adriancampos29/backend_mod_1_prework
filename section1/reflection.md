## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The superlearner article resonated with me because I want to be successful in this program and it gave me good tips on how to do this. From the list, I already view learning as a process. I know learing something new is hard, and takes time as well as patitence. I want to start doing more of taking short breaks because I often will sit at the computer for hours and burn myself out. The only thing I would add on this list is re read the instructions 3 or 4 times over before starting so you truly understand what the task is asking for. 

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
p "Hello World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

 integer is just a whole number like 10, float has a decimal like 10.1

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

 `animal`.
