## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

1). A point that resonated with me from the growth mindset article was doing the S.M.A.R.T goal setting technique. Often times when I try to do something new or challenging my goals will be either too vague or too unrealistic. This method allows for setting specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound goals. This is the everything I need in order to be successful here at turing and I will take it with me and apply throughout the course.

2). A brand new point the growth mindset article was to always be striving to push yourself with something that may seem daunting or out of scope, but in reality is able to be done with a little bit of elbow grease. Not everything is supposed to come easily and WILL take some practice. If everything was easy and comfortable no growth will come with that. There needs to be some struggle to grow. You need to be pushed in order to become more and more proficient.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I feel as if I do have some qualities of the growth mindset such as understanding that it'll not always be easy or come naturally. Sometimes you will need to mess up or not understand something and go back several times and reread or rewrite something in order to continue. There need to be errors so you can see what you did wrong and how to improve.

I don't possess all the growth mindset qualities that I would like such as seeking help as much as I would like. I enjoy being able to do something myself, however, I am starting to realize that asking for help is only beneficial for both parties involved. If I am stuck on something and someone who has more knowledge or understands the subject differently than I do is able to explain it to me differently, it not only helps me to understand a different perspective or way to do something, it also allows for them to hone their skills and really understand something. If you can explain how something is done or why its done a certain way, then you really understand the concept.

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

An array is an order based index based on integers. To call something from an array, you need to call it with cardinal based numbers, starting from 0. A hash is similar to an array, however, you can call from within the index with set keys. A hash has key-value pairs that are used to call from within. If you make a hash such as food, a key for example could be amount of pasta, and the value for that would be 2 boxes. Instead of using a number to call from the index, you would use the key word pasta.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.

```ruby
pet_store = {dog_food: 25, cat_food: 30, dog_toys: 140, cat_toys: 110}
```

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```ruby
states["IA"]
```

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

```ruby
print states.keys
print states.values
```
1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

We might want to use a hash when making a list of things and need to store the value or amount of things inside the list such as taking inventory of a warehouse. A hash is better than an array because you can be much more specific about certain aspects, and name the variables with the key-value pairing that the hash provides.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?
None yet. I think I understand this section well. Just may need some more practice will adding new variables or printing out variables without checking my notes.
